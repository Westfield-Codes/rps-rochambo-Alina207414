/* Steps 
*  0. Refer to https://lucid.app/lucidchart/3da5e3b5-33fe-4823-875c-81fb61c9d84c/view
*  1. Create Documentation and stubs for each function. //
*  2. Unit Test each function:
*     a. Add pseudocode based on flowchart, picking version
*     b. Test with console.log using stubs
*     c. Commit when it works.
*     d. Move to next function
*  3. System Test finished version (does it work right in all conditions?)
